# SDL
Messing around with sdl, different little simulations or games to get the hang of it. Below are descriptions for each program and what it does.

## Template
This is the first one I made, and it was the basis for most of the projects I built after. Here I figured out how to render and create a circle,
as well as event handling. Essentially code snippets for anything that would use circles later.

## Bouncy
This little simulation allowed me to implement movement of the ball, as well as collision detection which I used for the edges.

## Pong
This is exactly what it sounds like, but with some small differences from actual pong. There is no way to win, only lose :(. But just most other things are there.

## aimtrain
Spawns balls in random spots and check to see if the player clicks them. Nothing crazy.

## Honorable Mention
Placecircle was exactly that, but I had already included the tooling for it in the template file, because that's where I figured it out, but it
did not stand out enough to warrant its own folder.
